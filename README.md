# demand-forecasting
This repository includes scripts used for data analysis and demand prediction for my bachelor's work.

The research covers a range of models for demand predictions, such as exponential smoothing, SARIMAX, ARDL, machine learning methods, and neural networks like LSTM. Furthermore, the study also examines the impact of exogenous variables and feature engineering on different model performances. The main focus of this work is to find the best model for demand and revenue prediction for a company in a competitive environment.
